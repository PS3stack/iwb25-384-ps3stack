# PS3Stack Voting System

A comprehensive microservices-based electronic voting system built with Ballerina and Next.js, featuring real-time monitoring, census management, and AI-powered support.

This system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **API Gateway** - Central routing and authentication hub
- **Auth Service** - User authentication and authorization
- **Election Service** - Election and candidate management
- **Voter Service** - Voting operations and voter check-in
- **Support Service** - AI-powered chatbot support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Ballerina** (Swan Lake Update 8 or later)
- **Node.js** (18+ recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PS3stack/ps3stack-ballerina-competition.git
cd ps3stack-ballerina-competition
```

### 2. Start Backend Services

```bash
# Start all microservices (run each in a separate terminal)

# API Gateway
cd api_gateway
bal run

# Auth Service
cd ../services/auth_service
bal run

# Election Service
cd ../election_service
bal run

# Voter Service  
cd ../voter_service
bal run

# Support Service
cd ../support_service
bal run

# Census Service
cd ../census_service
bal run
```

### 3. Start Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080
- **Individual Services**: See service-specific README files

## üîë API Keys Configuration

### Required API Keys

The Support Service requires an **OpenAI API key** for AI-powered chatbot functionality:

1. **Obtain OpenAI API Key**:
   - Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create an account or sign in
   - Navigate to "API Keys" section
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the generated key (starts with `sk-`)

2. **Configure the Key**:
   - Navigate to `services/support_service/`
   - Copy `Config.toml.example` to `Config.toml`
   - Replace the placeholder with your actual API key:
   ```toml
   HTTP_PORT = 8083
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-actual-openai-api-key-here"
   ```

### Environment Files

Each service includes `.toml.example` files with placeholder values. Copy these to the actual config files and replace placeholders with real values:

- `api_gateway/Config.toml.example` ‚Üí `Config.toml`
- `services/*/Config.toml.example` ‚Üí `Config.toml`
- `client/.env.example` ‚Üí `.env.local`

**Important**: Never commit actual API keys to version control. The `.example` files are safe to commit as they contain only placeholders.

```

### Development Workflow

1. **Backend Development**: Modify Ballerina services in `services/` or `api_gateway/`
2. **Frontend Development**: Work in `client/` directory
3. **Testing**: Use the demo accounts for end-to-end testing
4. **API Testing**: Use tools like Postman or curl for API testing

### Configuration Management

All services use `Config.toml` files for configuration:
- Copy `.toml.example` files to `Config.toml`
- Set appropriate values for your environment
- Never commit actual API keys or sensitive data

## üö¢ Deployment
