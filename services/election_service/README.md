## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Election Not Found (404)**
   - Verify election ID exists
   - Check user permissions for election access
   - Ensure election hasn't been deleted

2. **Vote Casting Failed (400)**
   - Check if election is active
   - Verify voter hasn't already voted
   - Ensure candidate belongs to election

3. **Permission Denied (403)**
   - Verify user role permissions
   - Check if user has access to specific election
   - Ensure valid authentication token

4. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify database service is running
   - Check connection credentials
   - Ensure database schema is properly set up
